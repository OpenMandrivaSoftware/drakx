Still TODO: /home/rxu/work/drakx/advertising/
Also: abf.rosalinux.ru/soft/draklive-install is much more updated, use?
Modify drakx/images/python/*.py for version update
drakx/mdk-stage1/config-stage1.h must be updated with new mirror manager (grep -ir mandriva.com through whole drakx folder...)
steps_interactive.pm is hardcoding version, is this ok?
drakx/perl-install/install/pixmaps/ has banners and images
svnweb.mageia.org/soft?view=revision&revision=797 has a lot of good banner redesign
