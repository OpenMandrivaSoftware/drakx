Still TODO: /home/rxu/work/drakx/advertising/
Modify drakx/images/python/*.py for version update
drakx/mdk-stage1/config-stage1.h must be updated with new mirror manager (grep -ir mandriva.com through whole drakx folder...)
So must perl-install/mirror.pm ^
steps_interactive.pm is hardcoding version, is this ok?
drakx/perl-install/install/pixmaps/ has banners and images
svnweb.mageia.org/soft?view=revision&revision=797 has a lot of good banner redesign
Release notes taken from /usr/share/doc/mandriva-release-common
drakx/perl-install/install/share/meta-task taken from package meta-task. I set up a submodule; hope it works.

Must run images/make_boot_img before doing python dvd...

[15:16:50] <Xu_R> proyvind: So I converted the distribution.py script to use urllib2 so that I could run it... but what steps are you using to generate the final iso? 
[15:17:19] <Xu_R> I've tried it, but I'm unsure where stage1 & stage2 is coming from..
[18:10:32] <proyvind> Xu_R: look at make rules under images/ & perl-install/install/

perl-install/standalone/finish-install has the first-boot wizard
